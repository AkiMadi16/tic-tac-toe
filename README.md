# Tic Tac Toe
This is my very first website launched recently, in which, I have created a Tic-Tac-Toe game which my daughter's and my favourite game.
I think I have designed a kid friendly version. I have also added an option to input their names and my daughter played it with her school friends and imaginery friends which was amazing and made me happier to work on more with development ideas.

HTML was used for building the content of the website, CSS for styling and JS for implementing the tic-tac-game. I used DOM manipulation in JS to interact with the HTML elements.

## :page_facing_up: About
- Once you click on 'Click Here' link you were directed to my webpage and a pop up message asking to add your name and your game partner's name.
- Once you type name or your favourite game charactors you will be directed to the game board.
- First input Name will pop up on top and the first player will start with a "X" symbol.  
- You can restart the game from the restart button.
- You can switch players as well.

- Add in-app screenshots.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Initial stage of planning was easy for me but later I have  decided to reduced the amount of ideas I have implemented with my limited timeframe. 

- I have created a simple tic-box schedule with my MS project knowledge and I wanted to keep a track of my progress with tasks that I have planned.

- see below for tic-box plan I've created for tic-tac-toe game.

- [ ] 9 boxes for game deck
- [ ] Two buttons for players 1 & 2
- [ ] Three buttons -Start, restart and Quit button
- [ ] Select Players deck
- [ ] One box to show player wins(optional -How many times wins) 
- [ ] CSS styling - key values

## :tic-tac-toe game: Cool tech
- Programming languages (HTML /JAVA/ CSS)
- Animations
- media query to include CSS properties if the screens max width is 800px shows color changes. 

-  I was so happy to show my daughter the game board with her favourite pastel colors and animated shadow box lines.
 How it worked. 

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Anything a little broken (Draw condition was not succesful until I clearoff the click turn/ realized a pop up text box to fill in players names than a prompt is better to keep a record)

- Anything a LOT broken
- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...
- Use DOM manipulation effectively next time.
- Learn more and work more on some of the methods I - wasn't familier with.
- to clear off turncounter
- Better planing




## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Cool things I would add if I can keep working on - this
- Players deck 
- Choose their avatar
- More animation
- Chat box
- user friendly features and for all ages (Specially for - Kids, Women, Seniors)
