## :tic-tac-toe game: Cool tech
- Programming languages (HTML /JAVA)
- 
- Animations
- Anything else you'd be proud to show your parents

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Anything a little broken (Draw condition was not succesful but automatically fixed itself/ realized a pop up message on each player than a prompt is better )
- Anything a LOT broken
- Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken :unamused:)

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...
- Use DOM manipulation effectively next time.
- Learn more or work more on some of the methods I - wasn't familier with.



## :white_check_mark: Future features
